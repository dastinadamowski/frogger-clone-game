# Udacity Project: Frogger game clone

This is a modified version of one of the earliest games ever created - the **Frogger** arcade game, where the player must avoid the enemy as they cross towards the water. :frog: :frog: :frog:

If you are curious about the true origin of this classic game click [HERE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger)! :frog: :frog: :frog:

## How to run / Installation:

  * Download ZIP or clone the repo using git: [https://github.com/dastinadamowski/frogger-clone-game.git](https://github.com/dastinadamowski/frogger-clone-game.git).
  * Navigate to a location where you unzipped the file or cloned the repository.
  * Open the `index.html` in order to run the game in any modern browser.

## How to play / Gameplay:

  1. Press Enter to start the game.
  2. Use arrow keys to move your character.
  3. Grassland is a temporary safe haven. Stone tiles are invaded by hostile bugs.
  4. The objective is to reach the top (water tiles).
  5. Beware the game difficulty that increases every time you reach the water.
  6. Collect hearts to gain extra lives and don't take gems for granted as those charge your score up!
  7. You begin your survival with three lives but avoid the bugs at all costs.
  8. Once killed, you respawn in the grassland area but with one life less.
